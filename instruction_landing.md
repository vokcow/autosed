# Make Discrete Event Simulation feel simple, powerful, and sustainable

> Imagine that a decision as simple as choosing how many parts to store can change the climate footprint of an entire factory.

Meet **FlowBuffer**, the first discrete event simulation companion focused on **buffer optimization**, **energy efficiency**, and **real EBITDA impact**.

## Why buffers matter more than you think

- A poorly sized buffer can increase energy use through idle starts, stop–go cycles, and unplanned overtime.
- Right-sized buffers can reduce inventory, stabilize flow, and cut emissions by smoothing machine utilization and logistics.
- Discrete Event Simulation (DES) lets you test dozens of “what‑if” scenarios without touching the real line.

With FlowBuffer, operations teams can finally play with buffers like sliders, not source code.

## From complex SED tools to a friendly layer

Traditional DES tools are powerful but hard to use:
- Steep learning curve, heavy models, specialist-only interfaces.
- Weeks to build a model, days to test alternative buffer configurations.
- Little guidance on energy and carbon implications.

FlowBuffer sits **on top of your existing simulation tools** and translates complexity into:
- Simple buffer and policy controls.
- Visual, factory-style dashboards.
- Clear KPIs like throughput, WIP, lead time, and energy use per unit.

## Tangible impact in weeks, not years

Operations and sustainability teams use FlowBuffer to:

- Increase line throughput by **5–15%** without new machines, just smarter buffers.
- Cut average WIP and finished goods inventory by **10–30%**, freeing working capital.
- Reduce energy-related carbon emissions per unit by **5–12%** through smoother utilization.
- Unlock **3–8% EBITDA uplift** driven by higher productivity and lower operating cost.

All of this comes from better decisions about **where** to place buffers, **how big** they should be, and **how** they are replenished.

## Key capabilities

- **Buffer optimization assistant**  
  Interactively tune buffer sizes, reorder points, and control rules. See the impact on throughput, WIP, and service level in minutes.

- **Energy & CO₂ overlay**  
  Attach energy profiles and emission factors to resources. Instantly see how each scenario affects kWh, CO₂e, and cost per unit.

- **Scenario lab for “what‑ifs”**  
  Run multiple scenarios in parallel: demand spikes, machine outages, shift changes, and layout variants.

- **Factory-grade visuals**  
  Industrial but friendly interface: line diagrams, Sankey-style flow, heat maps for bottlenecks and energy hotspots.

- **Collaboration ready**  
  Share scenarios, annotate risks and assumptions, and export reports for operations, finance, and sustainability teams.

## Works with the tools you already have

FlowBuffer integrates with common DES and data sources:

- Compatible with **Simio, JaamSim, Simul8, Witness** and other SED engines through standard APIs.
- Imports structure, routing, and parameters from your existing models.
- Connects to CSV, SQL, and time-series data for demand and downtime.
- Exports results to your BI tools for cross-functional analysis.

No need to rebuild your models. Start from what you already trust, then add a smarter buffer layer.

## Who is using FlowBuffer?

Manufacturers and logistics players across sectors already explore FlowBuffer to improve their operations:

- **GreenPress Components** – Automotive Tier 1 supplier  
  “With FlowBuffer we reduced WIP buffers by 22% while keeping service level above 98%, freeing capital and stabilizing the line.”

- **BlueWave Appliances** – Consumer goods factory network  
  “Optimizing decoupling buffers across three plants gave us a 9% throughput increase and a measurable CO₂ reduction per unit.”

- **NordicRail Logistics** – Intermodal transport operator  
  “Scenario testing helped right-size yard buffers and cut unproductive moves, improving on-time performance and energy use.”

- **SunCore Foods** – Beverage and packaging producer  
  “In less than a month we identified where small buffer changes could save energy without hurting output.”

## Designed for engineers, friendly for everyone

FlowBuffer is built to feel like modern industrial software:

- Dark, workshop-inspired palettes with clear color coding for flow, queues, and bottlenecks.
- Minimal clutter; everything important fits into one main screen.
- Tooltips instead of manuals, presets instead of parameter jungles.
- Built-in templates for assembly lines, packaging cells, warehouses, and transport hubs.

If you can read a simple process diagram, you can use FlowBuffer.
